# HAM paper
Code stems from that associated with CFC plots in Ruffini et al 2025 https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.19.644090v3
(Cross-Frequency Coupling as a Neural Substrate for Prediction Error Evaluation: A Laminar Neural Mass Modeling Approach, 2025)

The LaNMM model is as the one described in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381192300085X?via%3Dihub 
(A physical neural mass model framework for the analysis of oscillatory generators from laminar electrophysiological recordings, Sanchez-Todo et al., 2023)

Notes: 
The LaNMM is also used  https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.15.628565v4
(Restoring Oscillatory Dynamics in Alzheimer’s Disease: A Laminar Whole-Brain Model of Serotonergic Psychedelic Effects, 2024)


The LaNMM is also used in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.26.645407v1
(Fast Interneuron Dysfunction in Laminar Neural Mass Model Reproduces Alzheimer’s Oscillatory Biomarkers, 2025)

(and probably more to follow)
In particular... this one. The HAM paper. We use LaNMM to demo modulation and demodulation (see "modulation" notebooks).
